# uberjar_builder


## what
a quick way to build uberjars.

## why
sometimes i need a jar with lots of stuff in it and i am not a pom expert.
so i just wanted something to take my dependencies and produce the jar.


## how
- have Docker and make installed
- edit pom.xml and add the dependencies you need
- run `make`
- find your uberjar in `target`



## notes

 uses java 11
